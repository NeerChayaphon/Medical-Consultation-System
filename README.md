The patient can choose a doctor to have a consultation by name and specialization and get the medical record that involve advisement or treatment from the doctor that have consult with because some of the case can be treat without going to the hospital. In the time of Covid 19 situation, hospital has become one of the most dangerous places. This website will be suitable for "New Normal" because it prevent oneself from having close contact with others.
